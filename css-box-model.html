    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
       elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>
    <div style='padding-top: 1px'></div> <!-- Invisible element to prevent vertical margin collapse -->
    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
       do not.
    </p>

    <p>
    Both &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are “container” elements that don’t have any affect on the semantic structure of an HTML document. They do, however, provide a hook for adding CSS styles to arbitrary sections of a web page. For example, sometimes you need to add an invisible box to prevent a margin collapse, or maybe you want to group the first few paragraphs of an article into a synopsis with slightly different text formatting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Default block-rendering behavior is for elements to fill the width of their container.
      Centering requires an explicit width property.

    <h1>
      Box Model Properties
    </h1>
    <p>The CSS Box Model includes 4 properties. Starting from the innermost HTML <em>Content</em> we have</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Content is the actual HTML element</li>
      <li>Padding is the clickable space around the Content</li>
      <li>Border is a line around the padded Content. CSS properties like 'background-color' are bound by this property.</li>
      <li>Margin is the always transparent non-clickable space/padding between the Border and other adjacent HTML elements</li>
    </ol>
    
    <hr/>
    <div id="divButton">Button</div>
    <div id="divButton">Button</div>
    <div id="divButton">Button</div>
    <p>
      CSS provides the width and height properties. These take precedence over the default size of a box’s content body.
      The width and height properties only define the size of a box’s content. Its padding and border are both added on top of whatever explicit dimensions you set.
    </p>
    
    <hr/>
    <p>
      There are three methods for horizontally aligning block-level elements: “auto-margins” for center alignment, “floats” for left/right alignment, and “flexbox” for complete control over alignment. Yes, unfortunately block-level alignment is totally unrelated to the text-align property.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you set the left and right margin of a block-level element to auto, it will center the block in its parent element.
